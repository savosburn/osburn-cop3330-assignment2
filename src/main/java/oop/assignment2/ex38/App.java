/*
Sometimes input you collect will need to be filtered down. Data structures and loops can make this process easier.

Create a program that prompts for a list of numbers, separated by spaces.
Have the program print out a new list containing only the even numbers.

Example Output
Enter a list of numbers, separated by spaces: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
The even numbers are 2 4 6 8.

Constraints
Convert the input to an array.
Many languages can easily convert strings to arrays with a built-in function that splits apart a string based on a specified delimiter.
Write your own algorithm—don’t rely on the language’s built-in filter or similar enumeration feature.
Use a function called filterEvenNumbers to encapsulate the logic for this. The function takes in the old array and returns the new array.
